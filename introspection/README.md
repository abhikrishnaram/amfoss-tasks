Hi üëã, I am Abhiram Krishna, S1 CSE B.


### Why must we choose you?

Though I have learned a bit on my own I still need good guidance and mentoring to take up and finish a complete application professionally and systematically. I also want to experience a collaborative working environment to make me eligible for an industry-standard professional. I am hoping that amFOSS can help me to improve my skills both technical and soft. 

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?

I am planning to try different fields of computer science other than web development to find what I like the most. I wanna try out systems programming, embedded systems, Operating systems, DevOps and networking; know more about those and find an area where I could concentrate. I also would like to take part in hackathons and events, work with the community and contribute to them.

### How would you contribute back to the club? 

I would dedicate a maximum of my time and best of my effort for the development and contribution to the club. I looking forward to representing the club in various events and keep up the glory that's been maintained. I would also like to be part of the organising committee or as tech support for different events conducted by the club.

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

One of the best selection processes, comprising of various different languages and fields üëç.


### My Story - 

It all started during my 8th grade when the teacher asked us to make a calculator in Visual Basic and promised a bar of chocolate for the person who does it first. Since then, I have loved coding. Then in the following year, I agreed to make a web app to conduct a quiz round in our school quiz competition. (I was a prominent member in many such events organised in my school and I love it). This marked the start of my web development career (though back then, I used the help of my brother to finish that particular project). From then onwards, I started learning more about computers as a whole and acting as a tech lead in events. Then during the pandemic era, I further started learning different web technologies and frameworks. Now I can proudly say that I am kinda a Full-stack developer(MERN stack).
