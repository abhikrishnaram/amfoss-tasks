I have been a linux user for quite some time now. So this is something I do usually. 

I have tried various linux distros including:

Mint
monjaro
elementray
debian 10
ubuntu(current)
tails os
garuda
arch(for 1 day only thou)

So yes i have distro hoped a couple of times and understood that debain is my best fit. In which I live ubuntu(thou its bloated). also non of the distros matter becoz the almost terminal is same in all those(debian based).
